# tic-tac-toe-game-
It is a two-player game and consists of a nine-square grid. Each player chooses their move with O or
X and marks their square one at each chance. The player who succeeds in making their marks all in
one line whether diagonally, horizontally, or vertically wins. The challenge for the other player is to
block the game for their opponent and also to make their chain. Try to create a basic game that can
be played once at least and will display which player is the winner.

How to play the game?
There are two players and 2 signs (x and o)
There is a board with 9 boxes
First one user has to place his sign in one of the empty boxes
Then the other user places his sign on another empty box
The goal is to place their respective signs completely row-wise or column-wise or
diagonally
The game goes on until one player wins the game or ends up in a draw by filling all
the boxes without winning
